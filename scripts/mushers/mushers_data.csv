Gabe Dunham,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1075-Gabe-Dunham/,true,I was born and raised in Fairbanks then my family moved to Valdez where I discovered my passion for outdoor adventures and animals.  I started running sled dogs when I was about 16 and ran my first race when I was 18, the Denali Dash 120 with only five dogs.  I moved to Willow where I worked for the Fiedlers and Alaska Heli-mush who mentored and taught me the best dog care and successful training techniques.  In 2011 I moved to Bend, Oregon where I completed a degree in Fish and Wildlife Management with OSU.  I had a small team of dogs and would enter every race I could get to from the Bachelor Butte to Wyoming Stage Stop.  I moved to Montana while running my sled-dog tour business, Evermore Adventures, in 2018.  This just drove my passion for mushing even more.  In 2019 I became the first woman to finish the Rocky Mountain Triple Crown, taking 2nd place.  In 2020 I set a course record in the Eagle Cap Extreme 200, and took 2nd place in Race to the Sky 300.   Today  I have 26 wonderful Alaskan huskies that love to go on adventures.  We’re all looking forward to running down the Iditarod trail.I would also like to take this moment to thank everyone who has helped me along the way.  You’re too numerous to name on here but you know who you are!  The Evermore dogs and I are eternally grateful for your support. Linwood and Kathy Fiedler

Mille Porsild,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1077-Mille-Porsild/,false,Mille started mushing in 1992, running a team of Polar Husky sled dogs for polar explorer Will Steger on a three-month-long dog sled expedition in Canada. She was hooked. Ever since Mille has lived with her sled dogs to experience the people and places in the magical North while finding ways to be share the adventures with people around the world. She has slept more than 1,000 nights in a tent on the dog sled expeditions and feels very home anywhere in the circumpolar Arctic. Mille has executed 15 long-haul expeditions with her Polar Husky freight dogs. Each expedition lasted two to six months and was as long as 3,000 miles in Greenland, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Alaska and crisscrossing Canada. In 2011 she entered her first sled dog race, running the 800-mile Nadezhda Hope race in Chukotka, Russia. Mille then moved to Alaska with Team Racing Beringia and her then partner. Together they trained and raced with great success that culminated in 2018 with his Iditarod championship.
Mille was born and grew up in Denmark until she came to America and did that first dog sled expedition at 18 years old. Her great-grandfather founded the world’s first Arctic research station in Greenland. His sons traveled Arctic North America by dog team and canoe in the 1920’s, the “normal” son being Mille’s grandfather who left Greenland to live back in Denmark. Growing up Mille would sit in his basement surrounded by drawings, mystical carvings and seal skin clothing, listening to his adventures as a kid across the ice with his sled dogs. That’s when Mille imagined she wanted to grow up to live her life with sled dogs.
The 2020 Iditarod Rookie of the Year, Mille in 2021 was the proud recipient of the Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award for her care of the dogs during the race, while she set a new time-record for mushers from outside the US. Mille lives in Alaska with her sled dogs, but she is still Danish. She will be racing the 2023 Iditarod for Team Racing Beringia.Alaska Realtors

Joshua Robbins,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1136-Joshua-Robbins/,true,This is my fourth year running sled dogs and with each season I continue to fall in love with the sport.  It’s been fun learning the team, strengthening our bond and exploring new grounds.  As a rookie to the Iditarod this year my goal is to complete the race and inspire others to try new things and not be afraid of failure.  I look forward to wearing my patriotic parka to represent the veteran community and honor those who fought for this country.  I’m thankful for the opportunity to run the Iditarod Trail and look forward to the challenge.,https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Robbins_Joshua_2024-150x195.jpg?e2ccc440,Willow, Alaska,http://www.outreach22.com

Travis Beals,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/394-Travis-Beals/,false,I grew up in Seward, Alaska. When I was young, my mom had a small sprint team on 2nd avenue right in the thick of town. As a toddler, I ran one dog races and was often found curled up sleeping with my dogs in their houses outside. My parents divorced when I was young and shortly after we sold the dogs. I wanted to get back into dogs and even as a young boy felt that dog mushing was my calling.I was fourteen when my mom said if I could pay for them, I was welcome to get my own dog team. I got my first job, working at a summer dog sled tour operation and shortly after got my first dogs. I’ve been racing and training my own dogs ever since. In 2009 I ran Jr. Iditarod at 17 years old with a team of dogs I trained on my own. That year I finished in 2nd, behind Cain Carter who was racing Lance Mackey’s A-team that went on to win the full 1,000-mile race two weeks later.In 2011, I met my partner Sarah. In 2012, we turned our kennel into a successful summer tour operation where we give summer dog sled rides. The following year, we took over Seward Helicopter Tours and began offering glacier dog sledding tours — allowing summertime visitors the opportunity to dog sled on snow. I’m blessed to be able to do what I love for work.I’ve raced nine Iditarods and each year have brought a competitive team to the event. For the past several years, we’ve spent winters in dry cabins and had to move our team around every 6 months. This year, Sarah and I welcomed our son, Elias. Being a father has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.Because we welcomed a son, the dry cabin life style was no longer going to cut it. This year we bought a house in Knik with trail access and it’s been a game changer.  I’ve always dreamed of winning Iditarod and, although I’ve always brought a competitive team, I’m starting to get to a point where the things in my life outside of mushing are in order to truly help make that happen.I’ve received a sportsmanship award every year for the last four years from various races including the 2022 Iditarod. These have been truly meaningful awards for me and I’m proud to be recognized by my peers in this capacity.I’m fired up for a great run in Iditarod 2024 and couldn’t be more grateful to my dogs and my family.Here are the dogs currently training for my team:

Rob Cooke,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1005-Rob-Cooke/,false,Have been racing Siberian Huskies since 1998, firstly taking part in dryland sprint in the UK, then short to mid-distance on the East Coast before taking part in long distance from 2012 onwards.  I originally came to North America in 2005 on an exchange from the UK Royal Navy with the Canadian Airforce but always with the intention of running the Yukon Quest.  After realizing a dream and finishing the Quest in 2013 I thought I would try the next challenge and enter for Quest and Iditarod in 2015, going on to finish both races we repeated the feat in 2016.  The goal is to run the race with a whole team that have not previously finished Iditarod, show them the trail and have fun whilst remembering the dogs from the kennel that have gone before.Dogbooties.com

Bryce Mumford,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1137-Bryce-Mumford/,true,Bryce Mumford, 43, lives in Preston, Idaho, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, Anna and Connor. His love of the outdoors and adventure started young, with his father, Rex, encouraging him with hunting, fishing, river rafting and camping. In 2008, an Iditarod television series got him interested in sled dogs and the Iditarod. It wasn’t very long before he got his first sled dogs. When he started racing dogs in longer races, his father was recruited to be his handler. His kids also began mushing in junior races. After a few years, his father decided he wanted to give mushing a try. It has become a hobby for the whole family. When Rex, Bryce and Anna ran the Idaho Sled Dog Challenge, a 100 mile race, together in 2022, they were dubbed by the local paper as the Mushng Mumfords. Their adventures as a family have brought them closer together and have helped them pursue challenging goals and endure difficult times. Without his family, pursuing Bryce’s dream of running the Iditarod would not be possible.Bryce has run multiple mid-distance races including Montana’s Race to the Sky 300, the Eagle Cap Extreme 200 in Oregon, and the Idaho Sled Dog Challenge 300. Finishing his first 300 mile race and being awarded The Best Cared for Team in the Race to the Sky was a highlight. He loves spending time with his dogs and watching them grow and work.Bryce would like to thank his parents for making this dream possible, his uncles and handlers, Jim, Gary and Sterling, and his wife and kids for allowing him to pursue the adventure of Iditarod. He would also like to thank the other mushers who’ve encouraged and helped him along the way.,https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mumford_Bryce_2024-150x195.jpg?e2ccc440,Preston, ID,http://www.mushingmumfords.com
Erin Altemus,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1138-Erin-Altemus/,true,My husband and I have been racing dogs for 12 years.  We learned to run dogs at YMCA Camp Menogyn and a few years later we acquired our own team.  A mushing friend invited us to a race and soon we were breeding dogs and racing.  We now have 30 dogs in our kennel located near Grand Marais, MN.  I work as a nurse at the local hospital.  Our usual roster of races includes the Beargrease, UP200, Can-Am and Gunflint Mail Run.  We have both wanted to run Iditarod for many years but the dream was sidelined for a while after the birth of our daughter Sylvia, now six.  Now we have the right team and the right circumstances and look forward to seeing Alaska behind a dog team.Mountain Ridge

Matt Hall,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1044-Matt-Hall/,false,Matt Hall, 32, was born and raised in Eagle, Alaska on the Yukon River, where he worked his trap line with his sled dogs and guided week long expeditions for his parents company, Bush Alaska Expeditions.

Jeff Reid,https://iditarod.com/race/2024/mushers/1142-Jeff-Reid/,true,A few months before leaving the Navy, my beloved dog Frank, who I rescued from Afghanistan, tragically passed away in a car accident. Losing Frank was incredibly difficult, and I felt like I would never connect with a dog in the same way again. However, reading Gary Paulsen’s book “Winter Dance,” which centers on the Iditarod, sparked an idea…perhaps I could find that special bond with a team of sled dogs while running this challenging race.My wife and I decided to turn this dream into a reality. We moved to Alaska in 2017, where I learned the art of dog mushing from Aliy Zirkle and Allen Moore while handling for SP Kennel. After that first season, my wife and I acquired dogs from SP Kennel and purchased property along with 6 dogs from Sebastian Schnuelle; giving birth to Frozen Trident Kennel. Over the next few years, we expanded our kennel alongside growing our family, juggling puppies and babies. We diligently worked toward qualifying for the Iditarod, and last year, we completed our final 300-mile qualifying race, bringing us one step close to our main goal…running the Iditarod.Team Dog
