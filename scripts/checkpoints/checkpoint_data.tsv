8	Rohn	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/8-Rohn/	188	Population 0 -- This area is tied with Rainy Pass as having the most spectacular scenery.  The gateway to the interior, Rohn Roadhouse marks the transition point where the mushers start to venture into the flatlands of the interior, along with dropping temperatures.  Situated near the confluence of the South Fork of the Kuskokwim and Tatina Rivers, the area served as one of the original Iditarod Trail Roadhouses for the dog teams carrying mail, etc.  The actual roadhouse is gone, so the checkpoint is a cabin built in the 1930’s. NOTE:  Most press people refer to this as the Rohn River checkpoint, but there is no Rohn River.  It's Rohn Roadhouse.  Mushers often decide to take their 24-hour layover here before heading across the bleak but treacherous Farewell Burn area.  There are no facilities for visitors to the checkpoint.	https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2310.jpg?e2ccc440

12	Ophir	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/12-Ophir/	352	Population 0 -- Now a ghost town, it took its name in 1908 from a nearby placer creek, one of a dozen streams in Alaska to be named by Bible-reading prospectors, for the lost country of Ophir, the source of King Solomon’s gold.  Many items and artifacts still remain untouched.  The checkpoint is at Dick and Audra Forsgren’s cabin.	
13	Iditarod	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/13-Iditarod/	432	This ghost town, once a bustling community of over 10,000, was the heart of the Iditarod Mining District, from whence the trail got its name.  Dog teams hauled supplies and mail into this area and were then laden with gold for their return trip out. Between 1908 and 1925, about $35 million in gold was taken from this area.  At that time, gold was worth around $20 an ounce. Iditarod marks the official half-way point in the race on the southern trail, signified by GCI’s presentation of the half-way award.	https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/37.jpg?e2ccc440
14	Shageluk	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/14-Shageluk/	487	Population 139 -- The name is an Ingalik Indian name meaning “village of the dog people,” and when the Iditarod hits town, that is especially true.

17	Eagle Island	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/17-Eagle-Island/	592	At this checkpoint, the musher finds his constant battle with cold winds on the Yukon River about half over, but it’s still a long 65 miles to the next checkpoint.

From here the trail continues overland for a short distance, then leads the mushers out onto the ice of Norton Bay, one of the most treacherous segments of trail that the musher may have to contend with.  The checkpoint is at the armory.	https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/30.jpg?e2ccc440

25	Nome	https://iditarod.com/race/2023/checkpoints/25-Nome/	998	Population 3576 -- The end of the Iditarod Trail! Prospectors established this Seward Peninsula city as Anvil City after adjacent Anvil Creek in 1898. A year later gold was discovered in beach sand and it became a boom town, home of 30,000 gold seekers. The city was renamed Nome in 1899 after a nearby point on Norton Sound, which got its name in 1853 when a British Navy cartographer misinterpreted a chart notation of “? Name” and recorded it as Nome. The gold rush atmosphere still abounds, especially when “Iditarod Fever” hits town with the entire community turning out to welcome the mushers and visitors alike to their community. Numerous stores, restaurants and bars line Nome’s infamous “Front Street”, but lodging is at a premium. If the hotels, Nome Nugget and the Aurora Inn are booked, contact the Nome Convention and Visitors Bureau for a list of bed and breakfast places or for any other lodging options they might have.	https://cloud.iditarod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/36.jpg?e2ccc440
